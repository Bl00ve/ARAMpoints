# ARAMpoints
A python script using Riot API which pulls stats from ARAM games over a time range

# Developer Notes
- I've used the Summoner and Match class over the course of my last few programs, but this time is probably the worst implementation. Still, pretty stable to port around if it's something you want to use.
- The program is commented pretty well and fairly straightforward, if you have any questions just ask.
